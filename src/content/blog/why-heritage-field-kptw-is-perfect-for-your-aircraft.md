_Discover why this historic Pennsylvania airfield offers the perfect blend of aviation heritage, modern facilities, and strategic location for discerning aircraft owners._

When you're choosing a home base for your aircraft, you're not just selecting a runway—you're choosing a partner in your aviation journey. At Heritage Field (KPTW) in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, we've discovered something special: an airport that seamlessly blends nearly a century of aviation heritage with cutting-edge facilities and strategic advantages that make it an ideal choice for sophisticated aircraft owners.

As a [professional aircraft management company](https://pennjet.net) based at Heritage Field, we've experienced firsthand the unique advantages this historic airfield offers to discerning aircraft owners.

## Pennsylvania's Aviation Heritage: From the Pitcairns to Today

Before we dive into what makes Heritage Field exceptional today, let's take a moment to appreciate the rich tapestry of aviation history that surrounds this remarkable airfield.

Heritage Field's story begins in 1928, but its connection to aviation excellence runs even deeper through Pennsylvania's legendary Pitcairn family. Harold Pitcairn, a visionary aviator and aircraft manufacturer, established his aviation empire just miles from what would become Heritage Field. The Pitcairn Aircraft Company didn't just build planes—they pioneered innovations that shaped modern aviation.

From their Pennsylvania base, the Pitcairns developed the autogiro (the precursor to the helicopter), revolutionized airmail service, and created aircraft that pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the sky. Their commitment to safety, innovation, and excellence became part of Pennsylvania's aviation DNA—values that continue to influence the aviation community here today.

**Fun fact**: The same spirit of innovation that drove Harold Pitcairn to experiment with rotating wing aircraft in the 1920s continues today at Heritage Field, where modern aircraft owners benefit from nearly a century of accumulated aviation expertise and tradition.
